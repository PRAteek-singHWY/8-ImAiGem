⭐️ iMagEM ---> Generate Imaginative Thoughts as Images⭐️

Description ---> A clean web application where users can enter prompts and generate their own imaginative thoughts as images. These generated images can be shared in real-time, allowing users to express their creativity and share their unique creations with others on the post page and even save your designs by downloading them.

Problems Faced ---> Here, this was my first interaction with OpenAI's { DALL·E } after { CHAT-GPT } , from thinking that the only way of generating imaginative images and designs was to pay and use Paid -Ai-image Tools/ , to finally creating my Own Ai text to Image Generator Tool, with the Image sharing Facility this project made me understand the power of Ai's DALL·E and flexibility it provides to users.
